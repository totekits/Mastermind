[This](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind) project is from the Odin Project's Ruby curriculum. 
## Assignment
1. Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computerâ€™s random code.
2. Refactor your code to allow the human player to choose whether they want to be the creator of the secret code or the guesser.
## Game Rules
1. Codemaker sets a 4-pin secret code
2. Codebreaker has 12 rounds to guess the secret code
3. If a guess pin matches both color and position, get a black pin feedback
