## Assignment
1. **Game Objective**: Develop a command-line Mastermind game in which you have 12 turns to decipher the secret code. The game starts with you attempting to guess the computer's randomly generated code.
2. **Player's Choice**: Enhance your code to allow the human player to choose whether they wish to create the secret code or be the guesser.
## Game Rules
1. **Secret Code**: The Codemaker (computer or human) generates a secret code composed of 4-digit numbers, ranging from 1 to 6.
2. **Codebreaker's Challenge**: The Codebreaker has 12 rounds to guess the secret code.
3. **Feedback System**: After each round, the Codebreaker will receive feedback in the form of symbols:
  - 'o': A correct number in the correct position.
